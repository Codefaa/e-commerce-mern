            <p className='faq-parrafo'>We use only the highest grade lumber in our solid white oak and walnut artifacts. The imagery we use has been provided to give you a visual representation of the grain, stain/finish, and color options available. Due to variations in digital displays we cannot guarantee that your product will be an identical match to the colors represented on our website. You will receive a product that is similar in grain and texture and typical of the wood species selected.</p>
            
            <p className='faq-parrafo-italic'>* Please understand that these are natural materials that have unique characteristics within every board. There is always a wide variety of grain and character in even the highest grade hardwoods. We will work with you to the best of our ability if you are not satisfied with your product but we cannot guarantee a specific type of grain or exact color for each product.</p>

            <p className='faq-parrafo'>For domestic orders it’s simple! Email us your order number and the specifics on which products you want to return within 30 days. We’ll send a return shipping label. Repackage the products how they were received. Cover up the old shipping label and apply the return label to the outside of the package. Drop it off at any FedEx location. Once the product is received in good condition you’ll be refunded minus the shipping cost. All international sales are final. All seating purchases are final. Please note that oversized artifacts like Tables are delivered on a pallet and you must have the pallet and original packaging in order to return.</p>

            <p className='faq-parrafo'>Most ARTIFOX products ship via FedEx Ground. Below is an illustration on how long a product takes to ship to your area once it leaves our shop. Items that are in stock take about 1 week to process and be picked up by FedEx. For more information check each product page for specific lead times. Please be patient with us as we’re still a lean team.</p>
